Exploring 2D physics and collisions.

In main1 added gravity so the balls fall to the bottom border.
In main2 added gravity and made the balls bounce by seting self.dx equal to itself times -1 and the implamented friction slows it down so they dont bounce forever.
In main3 I moved the time -1 to the less then functions (they didnt get stick in the corners nor pass through each other so I count it as a win, they also didnt vibrate like crazy and faze through each other)
